    "In this lab you will investigate and try to uncover biases in a machine learning model. You are free to use most any data as inputs, such as text data, table data, or images. You are free to use the code from class written in Keras/Tensorflow. As always, you can choose a PyTorch implementation if you prefer. The objective of the lab is to measure groups that are treated differently by one of these models. If using code from another author (not your own), you will be graded on the clarity of explanatory comments you add to the code. \n",

    "- Present an overview for (1) what type of bias you will be investigating, (2) what pre-trained model you will be investigating, and (3) why the particular investigation you will be doing is relevant.  \n",
    "    - You might consider asking questions like: Why is it important to find this kind of bias in machine learning models? Why will the type of investigation I am performing be relevant to other researchers or practitioners? Why might this particular model treat these groups unfairly?  \n",
    "    - You are free to look and compare bias among any groups. For instance, in class we looked at racial bias in names for a sentiment classifier. However, you might choose to investigate other forms of bias like gender, religion, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, or another grouping. The aim is to uncover groups that are treated systematically different by a model.  "
