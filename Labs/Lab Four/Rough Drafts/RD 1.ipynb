    "For the final class project, you should investigate a topic from the course of your choosing. This topic can be related to anything we have discussed. For instance, you might choose to investigate a new implementation of Stable Diffusion training with an alternative latent space function (or new form of cross attention). Please do not let this example bias your choosing of a project--the topic you choose to investigate does not need to be a new algorithmic approach. It could be a new application of an algorithm we discussed. For instance, you might choose to use multi-task modeling for assessing robotic surgery. Or you might choose a new topic in ethical considerations of models. The only requirement is that the idea be something that creates new knowledge in the world and is somehow related to the vast number of topics we discussed in the class. \n",

    "# **Objective**\n",
    "For our final project, we explore the application of **Reinforcement Learning** (RL) to the domain of **autonomous vehicles**, focusing on how RL can improve safety and decision-making processes in dynamic driving environments. Our analysis involves using a **simulated driving environment** (such as CARLA) to train an RL agent to perform basic tasks like navigation, obstacle avoidance, and interaction with other vehicles. By implementing and testing different RL algorithms, we seek to understand their effectiveness in making real-time driving decisions and to analyze how these algorithms can be adapted for real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our **primary objective** is to determine how RL can be used to teach an autonomous vehicle to navigate safely and efficiently within a simulated environment, and to assess the performance of different algorithms in handling complex driving scenarios. Additionally, we will explore the broader implications of RL in autonomous driving, including safety, efficiency, and ethics, with the goal of providing insights into potential challenges when deploying RL-based systems in real-wrold autonomous vehicles. \n",

    "## **1.1 Motivation for Our Research Project**\n",
    "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) represent one of the most transformative innovations in the modern transportation industry. While the technological advancements are promising from current projects like Waymo, the ability of AVs to make safe, efficient, and ethical driving decisions in real-time remains a critical challenge. AVs operate in highly dynamic environments with unpredictable conditions such as varying traffic patterns, road conditions, weather, and interactions with pedestrians and other vehicles. Reinforcement learning offers an opportunity to optimize the decision-making process through experience-based learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **motivation behind this project is to investigate how RL can improve AVs’ performance in terms of safety, efficiency, and adaptability**. By utilizing RL algorithms, we hope to enhance the vehicle’s ability to learn from its environment and make intelligent decisions, such as when to accelerate, brake, and avoid obstacles. These algorithms can also learn from different driving scenarios, enabling the vehicle to perform better in diverse real-world conditions, potentially reducing accidents and improving traffic flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The need for autonomous vehicles stems from a broader societal context. Human error accounts for the overwhelming majority of traffic accidents, and autonomous systems offer the potential to significantly reduce these numbers by eliminating distractions, fatigue, and impaired judgment. Moreover, AVs can provide mobility for individuals who are unable to drive, increase transportation efficiency through intelligent routing and coordination, and contribute to environmental sustainability by reducing emissions through smoother, optimized driving. As we move toward a future where AVs are more widely deployed, it becomes increasingly important to ensure these systems are capable of making real-time, intelligent decisions in complex environments. This project contributes to that goal by exploring reinforcement learning as a scalable, adaptable framework for safe and intelligent autonomous driving."

    "## **1.2 Why is this investigation important?**\n",
    "The importance of this research lies in addressing two fundamental issues in autonomous driving: **safety and real-time decision-making**. Current autonomous vehicle systems, while capable, still face significant limitations in complex and unpredictable driving environments, such as handling emergent situations (e.g., sudden traffic changes, pedestrians crossing the street) or adapting to new road conditions (e.g., weather, construction zones).\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, existing decision-making systems in AVs are often rule-based, relying on predefined algorithms. These can struggle to adapt to unforeseen circumstances. RL, however, allows the vehicle to learn from experience. By continuously interacting with its environment, an RL-based system can improve decision-making by understanding which actions lead to better outcomes (e.g., avoiding accidents, following traffic rules). This aligns well with the shift towards adaptive and intelligent systems in autonomous vehicles, which is necessary for widespread adoption and integration into public roads.\n",

    "## **1.3 Related Work**\n",
    "There has already been a lot of work done in applying reinforcement learning to autonomous vehicles. Companies like **Tesla** and **Waymo** have been leading the way in developing autonomous systems that can make real-time driving decisions using advanced machine learning techniques. Tesla’s Autopilot and Waymo’s fully autonomous cars both rely on deep learning models to control actions like steering, braking, and navigating complex environments. In the academic space, one of the most widely used tools is CARLA (Car Learning to Act), an open-source driving simulator created specifically for testing and training autonomous vehicles. Many researchers have used CARLA to apply reinforcement learning algorithms such as Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to teach agents how to drive safely, avoid obstacles, and interact with traffic. Another relevant area of work comes from DeepMind, which has used reinforcement learning to teach robots how to perform complex tasks by interacting with simulated environments. While their research focuses more on robotics, the techniques and successes they’ve had are very applicable to autonomous driving. Our project builds on those existing efforts by experimenting with RL algorithms in simulation, aiming to better understand how well these methods can handle real-world driving challenges like unpredictable traffic or sudden obstacles.\n",

    "## **1.4 Main Research Questions**\n",
    "One of the main questions we’re exploring is: **How can reinforcement learning actually improve the decision-making process in autonomous vehicles, especially in unpredictable or complex situations?** We want to see whether RL can help AVs make smarter, safer real-time choices when things like traffic jams, unexpected pedestrians, or road closures come up.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re also asking: **Which RL algorithms work best for teaching self-driving cars how to safely move through traffic and avoid obstacles?** To figure this out, we’ll be testing a few popular algorithms—like Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)—to see how well they handle tasks like staying on course, avoiding crashes, and reacting to changes in the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important question is: **How can we evaluate whether these RL systems are ready for real-world use?** It’s one thing for a model to perform well in a simulator, but we need to think about how those skills transfer to actual roads. This includes looking at how safe and efficient they are, and how they handle tricky situations that involve ethical decisions—like what to do in an unavoidable accident scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we want to look at **what specific challenges come up when using RL in real-world autonomous driving, and how we might deal with them.** Since RL depends a lot on simulation, there’s always a risk that the agent won’t behave the same way outside of that controlled setting. Part of our work will focus on finding ways to close that gap between learning in simulation and driving in the real world."

    "## **1.5 Our Hypothesis**\n",

    "\n",
    "- Deep Q-Learning Networks (DQN) will prove effective in improving basic tasks such as navigation and obstacle avoidance due to its ability to estimate Q-values and maximize long-term rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) will provide an efficient solution for training agents in large, continuous action spaces (e.g., steering, accelerating, braking) while ensuring stability in learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RL-trained agents will be able to navigate complex driving scenarios with a higher level of safety and efficiency compared to traditional, rule-based systems. However, there may be challenges related to transferring the learned behavior to real-world environments, especially in highly dynamic traffic conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect that RL-based autonomous vehicles will show improved performance in real-time decision-making tasks, but also face challenges in the scalability and robustness of learned behaviors when transitioning from simulated to real-world environments."
